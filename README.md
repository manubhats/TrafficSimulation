# Traffic Simulation of Self-Driven Cars 

An algorithm propsed by me and my team members to solve the issues of traffic management at an intersection. We named it the 'Collision Management' Algorithm. The Algorithm tries to increase the throughput of cars crossing the intersection by avoiding collisions, deadlocks and starvation of threads.

## Main Features Include
- Autonomous Traffic Management at intersection.
- Maximum Throughput at Intersection.
- Low Latency in Inter-thread communication.
- High Accuracy - NO Collisions.

## Implentation Details
- Java Multithreading : Each car arriving at an intersection is a thread
- Dividing the intersection into multiple blocks
- Locking the blocks based on the movement of cars
- Details about the cars are stored in HashMaps
- Java Swings for creating GUI
